Who, when or what created this extra layer to humanity?	Knowing what we do about science and evolution, and assuming that it's all correct, who was Adam? And by that I mean, who was the first person with a soul? Going from single celled organisms to humans, at some point something must have clicked over or something extra was added. I guess this assumes that animals don't have souls. Bonus question: do animals have souls? Do you have any insight as to who or when or what created this extra layer of humanity that connects with God and contemplates existance?

I'm a scientist and a believer and I have recently started to explore some of the doctrines and ideas that have been taught to me over my years in the church that I have just accepted. I found myself, as I am exploring those, going from a place of uncertainty on one side of the issue or the topic and coming to a place of certainty on the other side. I am trying to keep my mind open and remain in a place of uncertainty and embrace that. But it is difficult as I am always looking for facts and looking for certainty. How do you deal with this issue?

How do you deal with cognitive dissonance? 	How do you deal with cognitive dissonance? As an astrophysics enthusiast,  I see and read things every day that make me doubt the physical need for God or a higher power to have done something to make the universe the way it is today. But I still feel like there is this God or higher power. What do you do with that?

I have a question about a verse in Genesis. Gensis 6:2, the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful and they married who ever they chose. There is a lot about that that I have many questions about. I know you don't necessarily take Genesis literally but I think there is a lot here that we can dissect scientifically and in hand in hand with faith and spirituallity and stuff like that. I noticed a couple different things. One, that the sons of God are often take as angles because by the use of humans it implies that they were different beings that humans. What I found interesting was that angels, or fallen angels - I'm not sure about that- , found human women attractive which gives thought to angels features. Do they look similar to that of humans? Similar enough to find other of them attractive? I know it's not a new idea that angels got funky with human women because we see a lot of giants in the old testament and I know it's a theory that those were the angel human hybrids. What are your thoughts about that verse scientifically? Does that mean that angels have similar features to humans, that they have free will, that if you are a fallen angel then suddenly you can have free will, and that if you are a spiritual body that decides to become a physical body to hang out with a physical lady? I would love to hear you thoughts about it.

Hey Science Mike, I've got a three parter for you about the brain and spirituallity. The first part is, when we use our imaginations, what does that mean? In terms of the cognition... what parts of the brain get activated and interact with each other when our minds eye - our imagination - is being used? Second part is, what happens in the brain when we are praying and connecting with God. And finally, how do those two things interact? And can that teach us anything about spirituallity?
